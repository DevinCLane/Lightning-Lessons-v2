										<p>
											<blockquote>Devin is a great music teacher who has really helped me hone my guitar skills. I highly recommend him for anyone looking to get more serious about their music!
												<br>
												<i class="icon solid fa-bolt"></i> Amanda Salguero, of <a href="http://kingwillowmusic.com/" target="_blank">King Willow</a>
											</blockquote>							

											<blockquote>"I started studying to learn piano and guitar this year at age 64. I find Devin Lane to be very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about his teaching. He has an amazing talent and he works hard to bring me useful information and training. He keeps me motivated. He lit a fire in me and I practice nearly every day. His method of breaking skills down to the basics and his highly organized approach I find very useful."
											<br><i class="icon solid fa-bolt"></i> Danilo Santos 
										</blockquote>
									<blockquote>"I've been taking lessons with Devin for a couple of years now and in that amount of time I've gone from a very insecure guitarist to a semi-confident one that's just released my first EP! I've had bad experiences with guitar teachers in the past and Devin was the opposite. He was able to inspire and motivate without fear or shame, and really helped me build my confidence. He was able to curate the lessons around my specific goals and maintained a great balance structure and flexibility. He's intuitive, kind, and genuinely wants his students to excel. Best of all, Devin was able to make learning to play the guitar fun, when it has the potential to be frustrating and intimidating. Devin's deep understanding of the instrument, as well as music at large, makes him a great resource for anyone that's looking to improve their abilities."
										<br><i class="icon solid fa-bolt"></i> Gabrielle Tigan 
									</blockquote>
									<blockquote>“Devin is an awesome teacher! My daughter is making fast progress and has a lot of fun learning to play the electric guitar.” 
										<br><i class="icon solid fa-bolt"></i> Daphne K.
									</blockquote>
									<blockquote>"I love my lessons with Devin. He’s easy to talk to to tell him what I’m stuck on. He’s really creative and flexible and finds lots of ways to help me improve." 
										<br><i class="icon solid fa-bolt"></i> Lilly Q. 
										<br>10 years old
									</blockquote>
								<blockquote>"Devin keeps Lilly engaged and interested. He’s really patient, builds great rapport and tailors his coaching to her interests and needs. He’s also great at explaining what I, as a very non-musical parent, can do to support her." 
									<br><i class="icon solid fa-bolt"></i> Helen Q.
